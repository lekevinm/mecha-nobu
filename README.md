# nobu-master
Discord bot intended for personal server use, but can be added to other servers.

Can also be cloned and run on a local machine, but will require additional installs for full functionality.

Written in Python and uses the discord.py API (rewritten version).

Uses R6S API and TRN Fortnite Tracker for game stats, Anilist API to retrieve anime/manga links, and youtube_dl to stream YouTube audio.

Still adding and refining features, no official documentation until finished.

Current useful commands:

YouTube playback: !play (url or query) !volume (int) !skip !pause !resume !queue !stop

Game stats: !r6 (player) !fn (player)

MyAnimeList: !anime (query) !manga (query)

Miscellaneous: !poll (question option1 option2 etc) !timer (minutes) !help
